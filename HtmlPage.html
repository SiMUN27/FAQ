                                        The Exchange Visitor Program (EVP) was created as part of the Cultural Exchange Act of 1961
                                        to allow participants to temporarily reside in the United States and participate in a variety of
                                        education or training programs and to promote <b>cultural exchange</b> between the United States and other countries.

                                    <p>
                                        The program is grounded in U.S. public diplomacy efforts and its stated purpose is:<i>
                                            "to increase mutual understanding between the
                                            people of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational and cultural exchange; to strengthen the
                                            ties which unite us with other nations by demonstrating the educational and cultural interests, developments, and achievements of
                                            the people of the United States and other nations, and the contributions being made toward a peaceful and more fruitful life for
                                            people throughout the world; to promote international cooperation for educational and cultural advancement; and thus to assist in
                                            the development of friendly, sympathetic, and peaceful relations between the United States and the other countries of the world."

                                        A J-1 is a visa issued by the US Embassy or Consulate in your home country. It is a sticker on a page of your passport
                                        which allows you to enter the U.S. when you present it with your DS2019 Form at the border.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There is no fixed cap on the number of J-1 visas available annually, but each year the Department of State allocates
                                        a pre-set number of Certificates of Eligibility (Form DS 2019) to <b> program sponsors</b> to issue to potential
                                        participants across the country.

                                    <p>
                                        The J-1 visa is governed by specific regulatory requirements. For example:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                The minimal and the maximal duration of stay are determined by the specific J-1 category under which an

                                        Unlike many other countries, the U.S. authorities have delegated part of the visa procedure to organizations that act as a
                                        "legal sponsor". These can be viewed as an extension of the U.S. Embassy and are responsible for implementing programs in
                                        accordance with all U.S. regulations. You must work with a legal sponsor without exception as the U.S. embassies or consulates

                                        Sponsor will also <b>support and monitor </b>exchange visitors during their stay in the United States.
                                        During the program, participants can contact their sponsor if they have any questions or in a case of emergency.
                                        Sponsors charge participants program fees. Fees vary from sponsor to sponsor. Participants are encouraged to obtain a breakdown of
                                        all costs and fees from multiple sponsors before committing to a program.

                                        The consular officer will determine whether you qualify for the visa. He will look for the following:

                                        It is worth noting that these requirements are harder to meet in some countries.
                                        This depends on a number of applicants from your country that choose to illegally remain in the U.S after the program ends.
                                        If the percentage is significant, application process is probably going to be more demanding.

                                        Firstly, to answer the question directly:
                                        <b>The average worldwide fee for SWT program participation is $1,533</b>.
                                        However, in 2017 these program fees amount varied widely from $300 in France to $3,500 in Italy.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There is some risk of losing money in case your application fails: <br />
                                        The U.S. Consulates charge a non-refundable <b>consulate fee </b>for each visa processing.
                                        The current fee is $160.00 USD and is due before the interview. <br />
                                        Since September 1, 2004, an additional fee has been implemented, the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (<b>SEVIS</b>.)
                                        fee of $180.00 USD.
                                        Fees for the consulate and for the SEVIS registration cannot be compensated.
                                        If your visa is rejected by the US Embassy, you can recover part of the visa costs under some conditions.

                                        From our experience, it takes about <b>8-10 weeks </b>to apply for a visa.
                                        However, this timeframe depends on the cooperation from your host company as well as how fast you submit all of
                                        your required documents. Therefore, to avoid any delays, we advise you to start your visa application as early as possible.

                                        At the end of the year, you are eligible to get back some or all of the taxes you paid.
                                        As a J-1 visa holder, you are required to submit a tax return to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS),
                                        in the calendar year after the program.

                                        In this case, it is quite possible that the return amount is not insignificant.

                                        Your sponsor will probably offer to file a tax return for you. This service usually costs extra.
                                        There is a free alternative: you can file it yourself...if you are not bored by forms, definitions and instructions.

                                        Since the program is based on cultural exchange, you will have to explain how you interact with

                                        Yes. The J-1 visa for interns and trainees can be applied for multiple times. However, the certain requirement apply:

                                    <p>
                                        it is possible as long as you are officially enrolled as a student.
                                        However, you must return to your home country after your J-1 stay in the U.S.
                                        and a certain level of progress in your career is evident like completing another semester.

                                        If you wish to apply for another J-1 Trainee visa, you must wait a period of at least two years between two visas.
                                        The same applies if you already had a J-1 Intern visa and want to apply for the J-1 Trainee visa.

                                        Without SSN you won't be able to open a bank account, apply for a driver’s license or file your tax return.

                                        It is worth noting that if you already have a SSN, you do not need to get another one. A Social Security Number is for life.

                                        On average it takes applicants between 3-5 weeks to receive their Social Security number.
                                        However, employer can legally hire you if you have proof that you have already applied for your SSN.

                                        W-4 form is a tax form completed by an employee to indicate his or her tax situation (exemptions, status, etc.) to the employer.
                                        The W-4 form tells the employer the correct amount of tax to withhold from an employee's paycheck.
                                        The more deductions you take, the smaller your paycheck, but the larger your potential tax refund at the end of the year.
                                        It is a relatively simple concept, but the rules about what you can deduct and what you cannot deduct, whether you should
                                        deduct more or less income, and how changes in your pay rate affect deductions are complex.

                                    It is always a good idea to consider your options when it comes to choosing your sponsor.
                                    Here is a guide to help you determine which sponsor to pick:

                                            How much guidance will they provide in filling out the application forms? How much will your host company be involved in this process?

                                            Is the insurance optional or a mandatory part of the program? What are the benefits of the specific insurance plan? What are the additional costs per incident/illness?

                                            How bureaucratic is the program? I.e. number of reference letters required,
